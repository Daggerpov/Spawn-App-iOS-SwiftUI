# Components Folder Reorganization

## Overview
The `Views/Components/` folder has been reorganized to better segment components based on their functional area/module. This improves code organization, discoverability, and maintainability.

## New Structure

## Migration Notes

### Import Path Changes

If you were importing components from the root `Components` folder, you'll need to update the import paths. However, **Swift's module system typically handles this automatically** as long as the files remain in the same module.

### Example Updates (if needed)

**Before:**
```swift
// These imports should still work as-is since they're in the same module
import SwiftUI
```

**After:**
The files are still in the same module, so no import changes are needed. The file paths in Xcode will be updated automatically.

### Xcode Project Navigation

In Xcode, the folder structure will reflect these changes. You can now easily find components by their functional area:

- Need an activity component? Look in `Components/Activities/`
- Need a chat component? Look in `Components/Chat/`
- Need a form element? Look in `Components/Forms/`
- And so on...

## Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Components are now grouped by their functional purpose
2. **Better Maintainability**: Related components are co-located
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Smaller, focused directories instead of 35+ files in one folder
4. **Scalability**: Easier to add new components to the appropriate category
5. **Clearer Architecture**: The folder structure now reflects the app's architecture

## Component Categories Explained

### Activities
Components specifically used for activity creation, display, management, and interaction.

### Chat
Components for chat message display, reporting, and management.

### Forms
Input components, search bars, and form-related UI elements.

### Friends
Components for friend management, friend requests, and user interactions.

### Images
Image loading, caching, and display components.

### Map
Map-related views and components.

### Notifications
Error messages, in-app notifications, and alert components.

### Pickers
Various picker components (emoji, date, etc.).

### Shared
Reusable UI components used across multiple features (buttons, indicators, animations).

### Styles
View modifiers and styling utilities.

### TabBar
Navigation tab bar and related components.

### Tutorial
Onboarding and tutorial overlay components.

## Future Considerations

As the app grows, consider:
- Further subdividing large categories (e.g., splitting Activities into subfolders)
- Creating a `Shared/Buttons/` subfolder if button components proliferate
- Adding a `Shared/Cards/` folder for card-style components
- Creating module-specific component folders as features become more complex
