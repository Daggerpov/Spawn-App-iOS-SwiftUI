# ViewModels Reorganization and Logic Extraction - January 2025

## Summary
This document describes the comprehensive reorganization of the ViewModels folder structure and the extraction of business logic from views into view models.

## Goals
1. **Reorganize ViewModels folder**: Match the structure of Views/Pages for better organization
2. **Extract business logic**: Move complex logic from views into appropriate view models
3. **Improve maintainability**: Make the codebase easier to navigate and maintain
4. **Follow MVVM pattern**: Ensure proper separation of concerns

## Changes Made

### 1. ViewModels Folder Reorganization

Transformed the flat ViewModels structure into an organized hierarchy matching Views/Pages:

**Previous Structure:**
```
ViewModels/
├── Activity/ (7 view models)
├── UserAuthViewModel.swift
├── FeedViewModel.swift
├── MapViewModel.swift
├── ProfileViewModel.swift
├── FriendsTabViewModel.swift
├── SearchViewModel.swift
├── ChatViewModel.swift
├── TutorialViewModel.swift
├── ... (and others at root level)
```

**New Structure:**
```
ViewModels/
├── Activity/ (8 view models)
│   ├── ActivityCardViewModel.swift
│   ├── ActivityCreationViewModel.swift
│   ├── ActivityDescriptionViewModel.swift
│   ├── ActivityInfoViewModel.swift
│   ├── ActivityStatusViewModel.swift
│   ├── ActivityTypeViewModel.swift
│   ├── ChatViewModel.swift
│   └── DayActivitiesViewModel.swift
├── AuthFlow/ (2 view models)
│   ├── UserAuthViewModel.swift
│   └── VerificationCodeViewModel.swift (NEW)
├── FeedAndMap/ (2 view models)
│   ├── FeedViewModel.swift
│   └── MapViewModel.swift
├── Friends/ (4 view models)
│   ├── FriendRequestViewModel.swift
│   ├── FriendRequestsViewModel.swift
│   ├── FriendsTabViewModel.swift
│   └── SearchViewModel.swift
├── Profile/ (4 view models)
│   ├── BlockedUsersViewModel.swift
│   ├── FeedbackViewModel.swift
│   ├── MyReportsViewModel.swift
│   └── ProfileViewModel.swift
└── Shared/ (1 view model)
    └── TutorialViewModel.swift
```

### 2. Created New ViewModels

#### VerificationCodeViewModel
Created a dedicated view model for the verification code flow, extracting:
- Timer management for resend functionality
- Code validation logic
- Input field state management
- Paste handling logic
- API integration for verification and resend

**Benefits:**
- Removed 80+ lines of business logic from VerificationCodeView
- Improved testability of verification logic
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and extend

### 3. Enhanced Existing ViewModels

#### FriendsTabViewModel
Added new methods for user management and profile sharing:
- `copyProfileURL(for:)` - Copy profile URL to clipboard
- `shareProfile(for:)` - Share profile using system share sheet
- `blockUser(blockerId:blockedId:reason:)` - Block a user
- `removeFriendAndRefresh(currentUserId:friendUserId:)` - Remove friend and refresh data

**Benefits:**
- Removed 80+ lines of helper methods from FriendsTabView
- Centralized user management logic
- Improved code reusability
- Better error handling

### 4. Updated Views

#### VerificationCodeView
- Now uses VerificationCodeViewModel for all business logic
- Simplified to focus on UI presentation
- Updated initializer to accept UserAuthViewModel
- Better separation between auth and verification concerns

#### FriendsTabView
- Delegates all business logic to FriendsTabViewModel
- Removed helper methods for profile sharing and user management
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Focuses purely on UI composition

#### AuthNavigationModifier
- Updated to use new VerificationCodeView initializer
- Maintains navigation flow compatibility

### 5. File Moves Summary

**Moved to Activity/:**
- ChatViewModel.swift

**Moved to AuthFlow/:**
- UserAuthViewModel.swift

**Moved to FeedAndMap/:**
- FeedViewModel.swift
- MapViewModel.swift

**Moved to Friends/:**
- FriendRequestViewModel.swift
- FriendRequestsViewModel.swift
- FriendsTabViewModel.swift
- SearchViewModel.swift

**Moved to Profile/:**
- BlockedUsersViewModel.swift
- FeedbackViewModel.swift
- MyReportsViewModel.swift
- ProfileViewModel.swift

**Moved to Shared/:**
- TutorialViewModel.swift

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts
1. **Better Organization**: ViewModels are now grouped by feature, matching Views structure
2. **Improved Navigation**: Easier to find related view models
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Logic extraction makes views and view models easier to test and modify
4. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Views focus on UI, view models handle business logic
5. **Git History Preserved**: Used `git mv` to maintain file history

### Code Quality Improvements
- Reduced view file sizes by extracting business logic
- Improved code reusability across the app
- Better error handling in centralized locations
- Easier to test business logic in isolation

### No Breaking Changes
- All functionality remains the same
- Import statements don't need changes (same module)
- Existing code continues to work without modifications

## Future Recommendations

### Potential Improvements
1. **Deep Link Handling**: Consider extracting deep link logic from FriendsView into a dedicated service or view model
2. **Profile Sharing Service**: Could create a dedicated ProfileSharingService for reuse across the app
3. **Additional View Models**: Review other complex views (EditProfileView, ActivityCreationView) for potential logic extraction
4. **Consistent Naming**: Ensure all view models follow consistent naming conventions

### Views to Watch
While most views properly delegate to view models, these views have some complex logic that could potentially be extracted in the future:
- EditProfileView (orchestration logic between multiple view models)
- ActivityCreationView (multi-step form coordination)
- ManagePeopleView (friend selection and filtering)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all authentication flows (sign up, sign in, verification)
2. Test friend management features (add, remove, block)
3. Test profile sharing functionality
4. Verify deep linking still works correctly
5. Test navigation flows to ensure no regressions

## Conclusion
This reorganization significantly improves the codebase structure and maintainability. The ViewModels folder now mirrors the Views folder structure, making it intuitive to find related code. Business logic extraction into view models improves testability and follows MVVM best practices. All changes maintain backward compatibility while setting up the codebase for future improvements.
