# Spawn App Cursor Rules

This directory contains rules for the Cursor IDE to help enforce consistent coding standards in the Spawn iOS app.

## Purpose

These rules are designed to:
- Maintain consistent code style across the codebase
- Follow SwiftUI and Swift best practices
- Ensure new code matches existing patterns
- Help new contributors follow project conventions

## Rules Overview

The rules enforce conventions around:
- Indentation (using tabs)
- Variable and property organization
- Naming conventions
- Comment formatting
- Code structure within files
- MVVM architecture patterns
- Line length and spacing
- Bracing style
- API call organization
- SwiftUI view construction

## How to Use

Cursor will automatically apply these rules when you're working in the project. No additional setup is required.

## Contributing

If you need to modify these rules:
1. Update the `rules.json` file
2. Document any major changes
3. Ensure the rules reflect the actual coding practices in the project
